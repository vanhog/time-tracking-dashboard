## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https:/tailwindcss.com/) - CSS utility framework

### What I learned

I learned how to "instruction-based" popolate the DOM. This took me quite some time because it was  necessary to combine design and program logic in one step, what did not work out quite well. For the next projects I'll separate the data and structure more clearly from the rendering

### Continued development

Refabric the rendering to separate it from the data and program logic.
